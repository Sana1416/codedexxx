this repo is for me to clear all my concpets about git.
all of my understandings and misunderstandings.
we're doing it proper way here!
now i finally understood what a README.md file is without it overwhelming me.
this is my first README.md file which i myself made <3



read me files are written in markdown language. it is a markup language - allows u to add styled texts, images, links and even tables. then u have preview option, where u can see how all that markup code basically looks like. its basically a "welcome to my repo!!" file :3
